# ðŸ“š C++ Programs Collection

Welcome to my C++ Programs Repository! ðŸš€

This repository contains my practice codes and projects written in C++. It covers a wide range of fundamental topics, helping me strengthen my understanding of Data Structures, Algorithms, and Object-Oriented Programming.

## ðŸ“‚ Topics Covered

- **Array**  
  Basic and advanced problems involving 1D and 2D arrays, sorting, searching, and optimization techniques.

- **My Programs**  
  A collection of various C++ programs, from simple to complex, created during learning and practice sessions.

- **Linked List**  
  Implementation of singly, doubly, and circular linked lists, with operations like insertion, deletion, reversal, and more.

- **Stack**  
  Stack implementation using arrays and linked lists, along with classic problems like balanced parentheses, next greater element, etc.

- **Queue**  
  Queue and Circular Queue implementations, along with problems based on queues and dequeues.

- **OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming)**  
  Concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction through C++ programs.

- **Recursion**  
  Recursive solutions for mathematical problems, backtracking, and problem-solving strategies.

- **Sliding Window**  
  Efficient solutions to array and string problems using the sliding window technique for better performance.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
